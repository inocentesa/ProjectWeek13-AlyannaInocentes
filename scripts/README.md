# Cloud Network
This is a collection of Linux Scripts, Ansible Scripts and Diagrams from my Cybersecurity Class.

Most of the scripts are used to configure cloud servers with different docker containers

The final setup was 4 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with jump box and a server running an ELK stack container.
